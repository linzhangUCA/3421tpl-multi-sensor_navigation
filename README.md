# Final Project: Preliminary Navigation

## Background
Navigation is an essential functionality for any mobile robot. A robot is usually expected to autonomously navigate from a location to another, with the helps from various sensors. In this project, we'll implement autonomous navigation with our robots.

You are expected to
- Navigate the robot from the starting line to the marker out of the classroom. 
- Use at least one sensor (you are encouraged to use more).

## Procedure:
1. Set the robot behind the staring line.
2. Press the button to start navigation.
3. The robot should stop and terminate the navigation at the finish marker

## Requirements:

### (70%) Programming:
- (10%) Work modes:
    - The robot has 3 modes: **WORK**, **PAUSE** and **OFF**. 
    - One LED will be used to indicate the robot's status ("always on" for **WORK**, "fade-in-fade-out" for **PAUSE**, "off" for **OFF**).
    - A button will be used to switch modes bewteen **WORK** and **PAUSE**.

- (15%) Checkpoint 1
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 1` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (15%) Checkpoint 2
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 2` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (15%) Checkpoint 3
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 3` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (15%) Finish Marker
    - (5%) The robot successfully reached the `Finish` marker starting from the `Start` line.
    - (5%) The robot stopped at the `Finish` marker within 0.5 meters radius.
    - (5%) Turn off everything (except Raspberry Pi) on board.
    

### (30%) Documentation
A well-documented project can help people who are interested to follow. Also, it will be helpful if you want to continue the work after a while.  
1. (5%) Part List Table: list the names, descriptions and quantities of physical components used in this project.
2. (10%) Wiring Diagram: attach a drawing to illustrate components wiring.
3. (15%) Summary: describe technical details
