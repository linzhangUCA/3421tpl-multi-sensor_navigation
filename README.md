# Final Project: Preliminary Navigation

## Background
Navigation is an essential functionality for any mobile robot. Autonomous navigation can be achieved with the help of all the sensors and actuators. In this project, we'll realize basic autonomous navigation with our robots.

You are expected to
- Navigate the robot from the starting line to the marker out of the classroom. 
- Use at least one sensor from the following options:
    - Ultrasonic distance sensor
    - Lidar
    - Camera
**Note: DO NOT HARD CODE. Use at least one sensor. Or, 45% credits will not be given.**

## Procedure:
1. Set the robot behind the staring line.
2. Press the button to start navigation.
3. The robot should stop and terminate the navigation at the finish marker

## Requirements:

### (50%) Robot Performance:
- (5%) Modes:
    - The robot has 3 modes: **WORK**, **PAUSE** and **OFF**. 
    - One LED will be used to indicate the robot's status ("always on" for **WORK**, "fade-in-fade-out" for **PAUSE**, "off" for **OFF**).
    - A button will be used to switch modes bewteen **WORK** and **PAUSE**.

- (10%) Checkpoint 1
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 1` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (10%) Checkpoint 2
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 2` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (10%) Checkpoint 3
    - The robot successfully passes the `Checkpoint 3` line starting from the `Start` line.
- (15%) Finish Marker
    - (5%) The robot successfully reached the `Finish` marker starting from the `Start` line.
    - (5%) The robot stopped at the `Finish` marker within 0.5 meters radius.
    - (5%) Turn off everything (except Raspberry Pi) on board.
    
    > Note: you can guide your robot using ArUco marker in the final stage.
    

### (50%) Documentation
A well-documented project can help people who are interested to follow. Also, it will be helpful if you want to continue the work after a while.  
1. (20%) Methods
2. (5%) Part List.
3. (15%) Wiring Diagram.
4. (10%) Summary

## Methods
> Describe the navigation methods and all the related technical details (etc. sensors, motor speed offset, algorithms). You are encouraged to draw illustrative diagrams or upload assistive files.

## Part List
> List Name, Description, Quantity for each item (in a table).
